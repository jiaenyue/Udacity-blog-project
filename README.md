Stack Overflow Data - 2018 Survey

## Motivation
Based on the StackOverflow 2018 Developer Survey, among all 98,855 participants, there are 7,088 data scientists. What I am interested with is that what technologies they are using now, and what is the trend of data science.

## Labrary use:

pandas - data wrangling

plotly - data visualization

## Summary
Q1. what language is in fashion and what will be the new sexy?

*Python* again climbed in the popularity ranks on our survey. And this year we found that Python was also the most wanted language, meaning that out of data scientists who are not working with this technology, the highest percentage want to start this coming year.

*Julia* is gaining popularity, and although it did not make the 2018 popularity ranks, according to its performance on the wanted list, it could in 2019.

Q2. what framework is in fashion and what will be the new sexy?

The framework most loved by data scientists is *TensorFlow* which has received popularity over years.
*PyTorch* is getting its popularity rapidly.

Q3. which framework makes data scientists more money (who makes more money)?

Data scientists with more coding experience, using PyTorch are making more money.

# Acknowledgment
